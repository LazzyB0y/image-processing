# Image Processing Experiments

Various implementations of image processing algorithms for study. All done in vanilla Javascript.

Contains:

* Sobel edge detector [demo](https://piratefsh.github.io/image-processing/sobel/index.html) (p.s., it's slow, so wait for a bit)
* And more stuff coming soon, maybe?

## To run stuff locally
```
npm install
grunt serve
```

App should be serving at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) from which you can navigate to the respective files.

e.g to get to Sobel edge detector, go to http://localhost:9000/sobel/index.html
