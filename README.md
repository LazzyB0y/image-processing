# Image Processing Experiments

Various implementations of image processing algorithms for study. All done in vanilla Javascript.

Contains:

* Sobel edge detector [demo](https://piratefsh.github.io/image-processing/sobel/index.html) (p.s., it's slow, so wait for a bit)
* And more stuff coming soon, maybe?

## To look at stuff
Open index.html files in each folder, or view the demo links.
